- **Key Insight**: **Single** rooms have the highest average room rate, indicating their premium pricing compared to other room types. This suggests that guests may be willing to pay more for Single rooms, potentially due to their unique features or the target demographic favoring privacy.

### 2. **Booking Channel Distribution (Pie Chart)**
This chart presents the count of bookings through different channels, helping to identify the most and least used booking methods:

| **Booking Channel** | **Count**   |
|---------------------|-------------|

- **Key Insight**: The **Phone App** is the most popular booking method, which indicates a shift towards digital platforms for reservations. This suggests that investing in mobile app features and user experience could enhance customer satisfaction and potentially increase bookings. Conversely, the **Travel Agent** channel has the least activity, suggesting a need for businesses to reassess their partnerships and marketing strategies to improve visibility in that channel.

### 3. **Reservation Status & Rate Type Analysis (Horizontal Bar Graph)**
This graph breaks down **rate types** based on the reservation status, such as Completed, Weekday, Weekend, Extended, No-Show, and Reduced:

| Weekend             | 28,287      |
| **Total**           | **98,569**  |

- **Key Insight**: **Completed** reservations have the highest count across most rate types, indicating strong operational performance in converting inquiries into confirmed bookings. Additionally, the **Weekend** rate type shows substantial engagement, suggesting higher demand during weekends, which is typical in the hospitality industry. The lower counts for **Extended**, **No-Show**, and **Reduced** statuses point to effective management in reducing cancellations and optimizing occupancy.

### 4. **Weekend Rate Type Breakdown**
A deeper dive into the **Weekend** rate type:

| **Reservation Status** | **Count**   |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Completed              | 25,487      |
| Extended               | 561         |

| Reduced                | 283         |

- **Key Insight**: Among the weekend reservations, **Completed** statuses dominate, reinforcing the trend of higher occupancy on weekends. The small number of **Extended** reservations suggests that guests prefer shorter stays during this period, while the relatively low counts for **No-Show** and **Reduced** indicate effective booking confirmations.

### 5. **Guest Demographics (Bar Graph)**
The final graph showcases the distribution of adults and children across reservations, giving insight into family-oriented booking trends:

| **Adults**   | **Sum of Adults** | **Sum of Children** |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|

| 4            | 99,704            | 62,208              |
| **Grand Total** | **247,123**     | **246,306**         |

- **Key Insight**: As the number of adults increases (e.g., 4 adults), the corresponding number of children also rises, indicating a trend towards family bookings.
